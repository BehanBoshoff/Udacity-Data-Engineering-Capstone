# Udacity-Data-Engineering-Capstone
This project aims to combine four data sets containing immigration data, airport codes, demographics of US cities and global temperature data. The primary purpose of the combination is to create a schema which can be used to derive various correlations, trends and analytics. For example, one could attempt to correlate the influence of the average temperature of a migrant's resident country on their choice of US state, and what the current demographic layout of that state is.
